scrapes the links from various sites

## installation

npm install
```

## usage
```
# basic
node index.js
# outputs in data.json
# to list all the options
node index.js --help
```

## note
if you see some weird links that should be excluded let me know and I will add it to the exeption list, you can also do this your self but than it would only be fixed for you and the invalid link would still appear in lists from others. So please let me know too and I will fix it.
